## Previous Work

A <a href="cv.html">traditional CV</a> of work is available as well.

### Problem: Very large database queries in Python taking too much memory on Linux.
Solution: Build Java-based SQL query system that can flexibly perform the same actions with a much better garbage collector and constrained heap size with the JVM.

### Problem: Customers delete cookies and means ad targeting fails
Solution: Collect identifiers from first-party cookies in JS in a strong pattern, ship at scale to server, and use DynamoDB under complicated design to 'find' data from deleted cookies in realtime and wihin low-ms SLAs (developed before Dynamo supported multiple indicies).

### Problem: build out a forward deployed engineering function, yesterday
Solution: used network to identify specific coding bootcamps as a solid pipeline of high value talent with senior account management but junior engineering experience. Developed hiring plan, rubric, interview questions, and executed against that. Hired several engineers an built repeatable system that's proved sustainable for years.
