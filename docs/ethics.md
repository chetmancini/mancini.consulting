# Ethics and Disclaimer


## Security

No code is completely immune from security vulnerabilities. I may write code that has security vulnerabilities. They may compromise data security or user privacy. It is possible that I would not be able to write software that can prevent a sophisticated government attacker from compromising a system.



## Conflicts of Interest
Occasionally I may do a short experiment with a new or unfamiliar technology, even if I know I can implement something using an existing tool. I will benefit more from this than you will - it might not work, and I might have wasted a little time. In the long run, trying new things has made me a much more effective consultant than always staying in my lane. (Also, it's possible the new technology will work really well!)

If I have a choice between two solutions to a problem that are equivalent in implementation time/error rate/etc, I will choose the one that is more likely to advance my career, or lead to a future talk/blog post. I'm happy to credit you as a sponsor if I develop a blog post or talk based on something I've learned while working with you.

You might ask for a feature that I think is a bad idea. If I tell you I don't think it's a good idea, will this jeopardize our working relationship? In the past I have had success telling clients what I think; if you want to proceed despite my objections, I have no problems implementing the feature in question.

Related: if you think something would take a long time, and I can get it done quickly, I may be reducing the amount of time I can bill for! I'll never do something more slowly on purpose. If this reduces the amount of future work, beyond our contractual agreement, so be it; hopefully I can make up for it in recommendations from happy clients, or by working on other projects in the extra time we have.
